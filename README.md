# Cinema-Project

This is my project for pattern recognition course. In this project I used the IMDB data to know if the movie will earn based on similar movie views and gross by using several Machine Learning Algorithms. The main purpose of this project is to implement supervided machine learning algorithms. 

- The project was implemented using Colab, and utilizes popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

- project parts:

1. Data Understaning
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Modeling
4. Data Analysis
5. Linear Regression
6. Improvements

# 
The following libraries are required to run the project:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- math

Ths project is a collaborative effort with @khadejaYahya and Razan k. Alkhamisi. Special thanks for the creator of IMDB Dataset.
